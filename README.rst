                    String Matching Reaserch Tool
================================================================================

This is fork of the tool http://www.dmi.unict.it/~faro/smart.
The original project was updated in 2012, thus there are two goals:

* make the project compilable on recent system, i.e. ``make`` and
  a decent compiler, like GCC or clang;
* make all available implementations usable (now they're segfault).

The next step will be testing more algorithms, especially

Compilation
